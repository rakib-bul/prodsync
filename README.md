# 🚀 ProdSync  
## Garments Intelligence System

ProdSync is a desktop-based production monitoring and reconciliation tool built to reduce manual checking time of weekly production and shipment data in garment manufacturing operations.

It integrates Buyer Schedule files with Logic ERP production data and generates a complete production status overview — from cutting to shipment — in a single click.

---

## 📌 Overview

In garment factories, weekly production follow-up often requires:

- Manual comparison of multiple Excel sheets  
- Matching Job Numbers and Order Numbers  
- Checking cutting, sewing, finishing, and shipment quantities  
- Identifying shortages manually  

This process is slow and prone to human error.

**ProdSync automates the entire workflow and provides instant visibility of production status.**
